The earth is a freakishly huge floating ball on space for a tiny, insignificant human like me. Caring about my worries is probably the last thing that is in its mind. That is the same relationship that the title has with this text's body. Title doesn't care what the body is talking about. But this body is so eager to spend its finite sequence of letters to say something about the title's indifference. That doesn't sound so different from what I am doing. Spending my finite time yammering away at the Earth's indifference to my problems.

The Earth has to worry about a lot of things and she does not have any time for any other auxiliary and unimportant thing, they say. Well, fair enough. But the title does not have anything to worry about other than sit still and look pretty for the eyes. Why is it so indifferent with the text's body? No one knows what the title is thinking about, what it really is doing. But does that make it wrong for Title to ignore the text? Well, that's a fair question. The only thing that I can argue against it is my own ignorance on what it is doing. I don't really know if it is doing something or doing nothing at all. This does not stand firmly in my case against the Title's indifference. 

Imagine that I don't know what the Earth is doing. I know nothing about the complex web of processes that it maintains in order to keep this ball spinning in space. Would my attitude toward it be less considerate? Probably. But since I do have a very slight inkling of an idea, my attitude towards it largely changes. The matter with the Title is the same thing.
